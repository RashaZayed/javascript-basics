            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is across-platform, object-oriented scripting laguage. JavaScript is extremely popular for 
                a variety of reasons.It's small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexability for develpers to 
                take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(web browser or Node server),
                it can be connected to the objects of these environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data,
                        imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,a variable holds a value.
                        All javascript variables must identified with unique names.These unique names are called
                        identifiers. <var>var x; </var>
                     </li>
                     <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment opertators assign values to variables-our 
                        cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                        The  = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <var>var x=10;</var>
                    
                    
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept, to be be able to operate on
                        a variable you need to know the data type, there are six data types:
                        Boolean-<var>true</var>or <var>false</var>, null- <var>null</var>aka nothing,
                        Number- <var>42</var> or <var>3.1345</var>; String - <var>"Coding Dojo Rocks";</var>
                        Array - <var>[1,"Coding",2,"Dojo"];</var> and object - <var>{first_name:'jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</var>

                    </li>
                    <li><a href="">Conditionals </a>When you write code, you want to perform different decisions- hitting
                        different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. you can use Conditional
                        statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditonal statements:
                        <var>if</var> a specified condition is true,do this code block: <var>else if</var>to specify a new
                        condition to test,if the first condition is false, <var>else</var> we execute this block of code;

                    </li>
                    <li><a href="">loops</a> There are many different kinds loops in every programming language, but they allowing
                        do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you
                        run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!

                    </li>
                    <li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function,this will
                        run our code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
                        from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,first we screw the legs to the table top; next we
                        place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so
                        lets call our function over and over again.

                    </li>
                </ul>
